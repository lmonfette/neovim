--- plugins ---

- the package manager I use is called "Lazy" (for lazy loading)
- to open the manager, write the normal mode command: ":Lazy"
- it is possible to see all the loaded and installed plugins
- refer to /lua/config/lazy.lua for the configuration

--- notes ---

- any directory in the /lua directory can be required by lua (put it there if you need to require it somewhere)
- /lua/config I have decided to put the personal configs
- /lua/plugins is where the plugins I want are defined, please check the "plugins" sections higher
