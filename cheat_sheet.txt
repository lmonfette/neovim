--- plugins ---

- the package manager I use is called "Lazy" (for lazy loading)
- to open the manager, write the normal mode command: ":Lazy"
- it is possible to see all the loaded and installed plugins
- refer to /lua/config/lazy.lua for the configuration

--- notes ---

- any directory in the /lua directory can be required by lua (put it there if you need to require it somewhere)
- /lua/config I have decided to put the personal configs
- /lua/plugins is where the plugins I want are defined, please check the "plugins" sections higher

--- nvim-tree ---

- pressing 'a' when in the explorer create a file or folder. adding a trailing / makes it a folder
- pressing 'r' prompts to rename
- pressing 'd' prompts to delete
- backspace closes a hovered folder
- <C-]> navigate into a folder

--- navigation ---
- <C-o> follow link (not sure)
- <C-i> come back from a followed link (not sure)

Vim has many options that can be set.

To check which options are set from their different values, do the command:

":set < >|<all>|<option_name>"
