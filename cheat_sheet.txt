--- plugins ---

- the package manager I use is called "Lazy" (for lazy loading)
- to open the manager, write the normal mode command: ":Lazy"
- it is possible to see all the loaded and installed plugins
- refer to /lua/config/lazy.lua for the configuration

--- notes ---

- any directory in the /lua directory can be required by lua (put it there if you need to require it somewhere)
- /lua/config I have decided to put the personal configs
- /lua/plugins is where the plugins I want are defined, please check the "plugins" sections higher

--- nvim-tree ---

- pressing 'a' when in the explorer create a file or folder. adding a trailing / makes it a folder
- pressing 'r' prompts to rename
- pressing 'd' prompts to delete
- backspace closes a hovered folder
- <C-]> navigate into a folder

--- navigation ---
- <C-o> follow link (not sure)
- <C-i> come back from a followed link (not sure)

------------------------ READING VIM DOC ------------------------

Vim has many options that can be set.

To check which options are set from their different values, do the command:

":set < >|<all>|<option_name>"

---------- other -------------

1. pressing ":" when selecting multiple line will apply a command on all those line. ex:

:'<,'>d will delete all the lines
:'<,'>y will yank all the lines
:'<,'>norm A"; will move the cursor at the end of all the lines, enter insert mode and then write ";

2. hovering a number and pressing <C-a> will increase the number

try it: 3, 43, 102

3. hovering a number and pressing <C-x> will decrease the number

try it: 5, 42, 101

4. <C-a> jumps to the next number and increments is, <C-x> jumps to it and decrements it

word word words 2, some other words 4

5. selecting all the lines containing some number and then pressing <g-C-a> will order them

try it:

0.
0.
0.

gives:

1.
2.
3.

6. daw -> delete a word, diw -> delete inner word, ciw -> change a word, but:

if there is a text like this:

[({"hello"})]

I can do: ci", ci}, ci) or ci] and if will change everything inside those delimiters.
You can also write the opening or closing [/]. it does not matter

- ci}
- va}
- vi}

try it:

[({"hello"})]

7. W jumps to the next word (instead of just the next word or delimiter), you can combine it:

jump to hello from beginning of the beginning of the line:

salut:salut hello yolo

don't forget that you can use actions like this:

- vW
- dW
- diW

try it:

salut:salut hello yolo

8. folding

zo → Open the current fold (unfold one level).
zO → Open recursively (unfold all nested folds inside the current fold).
zc → Close the current fold.
zC → Close recursively (fold all nested folds inside).
za → Toggle fold open/close.
zR → Open all folds in the buffer (fully unfold everything).
zM → Close all folds in the buffer (fully fold everything)
